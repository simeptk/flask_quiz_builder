*   **Low Latency Routing:**
    *   **Service:** Global External Proxy Network Load Balancing (TCP/SSL) or Global Network Load Balancing (TCP/UDP) with Network Endpoint Groups (NEGs).
    *   **Why:** Routes game session traffic directly to the correct GKE pod running the game server instance in the closest regional cluster, bypassing traditional VM-based backends. This is critical for minimizing in-game latency.
    *   **Crispy Hint:**
        *   *CLI:* `gcloud compute network-endpoint-groups create my-neg --gke-zone=us-central1-a --gke-cluster=my-game-cluster --service=my-game-service --neg-type=container` (Creates a NEG pointing to GKE service pods)
        *   *Console:* Navigate to `Network Services` -> `Load Balancing`. Create the appropriate global load balancer and configure a Backend Service pointing to a `Network Endpoint Group` you've created for your GKE service.

*   **Enhanced Security:**
    *   **Service:** IAM, VPC Service Controls, Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP), Cloud KMS, Secret Manager, Cloud Audit Logs.
    *   **Why:** Provides fine-grained access control (IAM). Prevents data exfiltration from sensitive services (VPC Service Controls). Provides secure, identity-aware access to internal resources without VPNs (IAP for remote dev). Securely manages encryption keys (KMS) and secrets (Secret Manager). Provides audit trails for compliance (Cloud Audit Logs).
    *   **Crispy Hint:**
        *   *CLI:* `gcloud iam roles create my-custom-role --project=my-project --permissions=bigquery.tables.getData,bigquery.jobs.create ...`, `gcloud access-context-manager perimeters create my-perimeter --resources=projects/PROJECT_NUMBER --restricted-services=bigquery.googleapis.com,storage.googleapis.com ...` (Creates a custom IAM role and a VPC Service Control perimeter)
        *   *Console:* Navigate to `IAM & Admin` to manage roles and permissions. Navigate to `Security` -> `VPC Service Controls` to configure perimeters. Navigate to `Security` -> `Identity-Aware Proxy` to configure access to resources. Navigate to `Security` -> `Key Management` and `Secret Manager` to manage keys and secrets. Review logs in `Operations` -> `Logging` -> `Audit Logs`.
